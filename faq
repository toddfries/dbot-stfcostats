Does this bot violate scopley tos?  I believe it does not. Here is why:

  Reading https://scopely.com/tos/ I see sections one might be concerned with. Namely...

  I am not permitted to..

    o Engage in unlawful, abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory, libelous, harassing, hateful, violent, racist, or otherwise objectionable or offensive acts, whether by posting and/or transmitting such information through our Services, or by any other means (e.g., by posting links to such content).
    o Engage in acts or attempts to abuse, threaten, harm, harass, or advocate or incite harassment and/or violence towards another person, group, our employee(s) or our Services, or engage in any acts in violation of other publicly posted Scopely policies (e.g. forum rules).

  If I get together with a group of players and go retaliate roe violations, my bot only makes it
  easier for us to share searching and info with said group of players.  Remove my bot, we are doing
  nothing different, just less efficiently.  Are we harassing someone who has targeted us?  I am not
  convinced we are.

  I am not permitted to..

    o Scrape, harvest, or extract data from the Services.

  My bot aims to let players provide the info, it is a glorified shared spreadsheet with some interaction built in.  Scraping, harvesting, extracting data was what scotty's workshop did. Directly contacting the servers and with a program extracting info directly.

  I am not permitted to..

    o Create, use, offer, promote, advertise, make available, and/or distribute exploits, cheats, bots, software, hacks, mods or any unauthorized third party code or software that can be used to interfere with, alter or modify our Services, or that can be used in conjunction with our Services.

  I read this as "Do anything that can interact with STFC" and I am not.


What I am doing involves helping players share searching the galaxy for hollow at first, but in the future.
