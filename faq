Save your officer stats and get back some useful bits in the process.
That is to say, input your data, so you can query it. 

 **Grade Key**
 1 = Ensign I
 2 = Lieut. JG II
 3 = Lieut. III
 4 = Commander IV
 5 = Commander V

**Command**: i (input officer status)

 i <shortname> <grade> <level> <attack> <defense> <health>

**Example**:

 i t'laan 5 30 97 210 81 
 i helvia 5 30 32 194 161

**Command**: q (query officer stats)

 q <command> <args>

 q top 5 attack
 q top 5 health
 q top 5 defense
 q top 5 health+defense

 q <shortname>

**Note**
- Your unique discord id will be used to distinguish your data from someone else's.
- feel free to PM this bot, your stats need not be visible to all

**Caveats**
- if output exceeds discord limits, no output will be seen. fix coming.
- cannot issue `q t'laan` as the ' char is not handled properly. fix coming.
- officers are stored as lowercase in the database. expect lower case in bot output.
- the bot cannot handle officer names with spaces. use underscores for now.
- contact me <@541872005998182423> if you observe bugs or have ideas.
